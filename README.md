# Project Overview
## The central objective of this project is to capture multiple faces with maximum accuracy.
    Build an attendance system using computer vision. 
    The user should be able to feed the system with a live stream of 
    video or an image and the attendance for that particular audience 
    should be marked automatically in real time. The user should be 
    able to verify the same before submitting.

# AI-attendance-system
    - 1 :  Register yourself and capture face data.
    - 2 :  Faculty in-charge can allow certain restrictions/- 
    - permission in that case the system must be able to retain the studentâ€™s attendance.
    - 3 :  A  student, upon showing his/her face( kind of l
    - ogin portal) can access his/her attendance data
